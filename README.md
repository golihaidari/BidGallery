**ArtBid** is a web application designed for a group of artists to showcase and sell their artworks through a single online channel.
The platform introduces an innovative bidding system where customers can "Bid What You Want," and if their bid meets a secret minimum price, the purchase is confirmed automatically.

Key Features:
**-** Multiple products and product types (paintings, prints, sculptures, etc.)
**-** Flexible artist management (add/remove artists, profiles, and types)
**-** Quantity-based sales and bulk purchases
**-** Customer feedback and review system
**-** Marketing integration (social media, newsletters, SEO)
**-** Secure payment processing
**-** Press and media support for artist promotion
**-** Scalable architecture for future features (AR gallery, digital art/NFT integration)

This project is ideal for collaborative art groups looking to modernize their sales, engage with customers, and manage multiple artists efficiently.
